# Wasp Drone
Senior Capstone Project for CSE 4316 and CSE 4317 Computer System Design Project I and II at UT Arlington Department of Computer Science and Engineering by team Verminator.

## Summary of Work
In this project, we propose a design for an aerial spraying platform. The idea is to have insecticide sprayers mounted onto a drone. Then, the product can be used to spray insecticides on wasp nests, or other insect nests, in hard to reach areas.

This repository contains source code, links to other repositories, STL files for 3D models, and other documentation used in the development of this project.

## Getting Started
This repository contains source code and links to other repositories with source code. After cloning this repository, run the following command to obtain source code from included submodules:
```
  git submodule update --init  --recursive
```

## About the Team
The team is named after Dwayne LaFontant aka The Verminator from Over the Hedge produced by DreamWorks. The team's emblem takes inspiration from Helldivers 2 by Arrowhead Game Studios.
